# Summary Tables

1. The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page.
2. A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the `<tr>` element.
3. Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a header).
4. You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
5. For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.
