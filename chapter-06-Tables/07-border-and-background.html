<!--
  Old Code: Border & Background

    The border attribute was used on both the <table> and <td> elements to indicate the width of the border in pixels.
    The bgcolor attribute was used to indicate background colors of either the entire table or individual table cells. The value is usually a hex code.
    This example uses the HTML border and bgcolor attributes.
    No CSS attributes were utilized in this example.
    When building a new website you should use CSS to control the appearance of the table rather than these attributes.
    They are only covered here because you may come across them if you look at the code of older websites.
