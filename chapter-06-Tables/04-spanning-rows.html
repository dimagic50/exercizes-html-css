<!--
  Spanning rows:
  
  You may also need entries in a table to stretch down across more than one row.
  The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.
  In this example you can see that ABC is showing a movie from 6pm - 8pm, whereas the BBC and CNN channels are both showing two programs during this time period (each of which lasts one hour).
  If you look at the last <tr> element, it only contains three elements even though there are four columns in the result below. This is because the movie in the <tr> element above it uses the rowspan attribute to stretch down and take over the cell below.
  I have added some CSS styles to this example so that you can see how the cells span more than one row. You will learn how to apply these CSS styles to tables.
