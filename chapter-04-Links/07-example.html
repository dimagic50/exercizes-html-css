  The <h1> element is used with an id attribute at the top of the page so that a link can be added to take readers from the bottom of the page to the top. There is an email link to allow readers to contact the author of the web page. There are also a number of links to qualified URLs. These link to various film festivals. Below this list is a link to a relative URL which is an "about" page that lives in the directory other-pages.
