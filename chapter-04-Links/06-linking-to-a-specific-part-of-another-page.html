<!--
  If you want to link to a specific part of a different page (whether
on your own site or a different website) you can use a similar technique.
As long as the page you are linking to has id attributes that identify specific parts of the page, you can simply add the same syntax to the end of the
link for that page. Therefore, the href attribute will contain the address for the page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.
For example, to link to the bottom of the homepage of the website that accompanies this book, you would write:
<a href="http:/www.htmlandcssbook.com/#bottom">
