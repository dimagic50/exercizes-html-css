# Summary LINKS

1. Links are created using the `<a>` element.
2. The `<a>` element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
3. If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
4. You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
5. You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
