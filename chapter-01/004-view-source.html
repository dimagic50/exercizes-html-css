  When the web was first taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages. These days there are many more books and online tutorials that teach HTML, but you can still look at the code that a web server sends to you. To try this out for yourself, simply open this page and look for the View menu in your browser. Select the option that says Source or View source. (The title changes depending on what browser you are using.)
  You should see a new window appear, and it will contain the source code that was used to create this page. At first this code might look complicated but don't be discouraged. By the time you will be able to understand it.
