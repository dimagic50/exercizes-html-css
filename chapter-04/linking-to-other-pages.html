  When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL. If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file.
  If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more complex syntax to indicate where the page is in relation to the current page. 
  RELATIVE URLs: When linking to other pages within the same site, you can use relative URLs. These are like a shorthand version of absolute URLs because you do not need to specify the domain name. There are several helpful shortcuts you can use to write links to other pages on your own website.
