# Summary IMAGES

1. The `<img>` element is used to add images to a web page.
2. You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
3. You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
4. Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
