  Old Code: Aligning Images Horizontally.

  align:
    The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images. I have discussed it here because you are likely to come across it if you look at older code, and because some visual editors still insert this attribute when you indicate how an image should be aligned.
    The align attribute can take these horizontal values:
  left:
    This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side). This looks a lot neater than having one line of text next to the image (as shown on the previous example). When you give the align
    attribute a value of left, the image is placed on the left and text flows around it.
  right:
    This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its
    left-hand side). When you give the align attribute a value of right, the
    image is placed on the right and the text flows around it. When text flows right up to the edge of an image it can make it harder to read. You will learn how to add a gap between text and images using the CSS padding and
    margin properties.
