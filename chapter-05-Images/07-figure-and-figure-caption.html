    <figure>
  Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new <figure> element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.
  You can have more than one image inside the <figure> element as long as they all share the same caption. 
  
    <figcaption>
  The <figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image. Before these elements were created there was no way to associate an <img> element with its caption.
  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements simply ignore the new elements and display the content of them.
