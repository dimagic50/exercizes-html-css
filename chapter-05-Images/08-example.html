<!-- 
  In this example, the logo is a GIF because it uses flat colors, while the photographs are JPEGs. The main photo is placed inside the HTML5 <figure> element and has its own caption.

  The alt attribute on each image provides a description for those using screen readers and the title attribute provides additional information. (This is shown in the tooltip.)

  This example does not use the height, width, or align attributes as these are
  being phased out and you are encouraged to use CSS properties instead.

  Summary IMAGES:
  1) The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.
  2) You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
  3) You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
  4) Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
