<!-- 
  In this example, the logo is a GIF because it uses flat colors, while the photographs are JPEGs. The main photo is placed inside the HTML5 <figure> element and has its own caption.

  The alt attribute on each image provides a description for those using screen readers and the title attribute provides additional information. (This is shown in the tooltip.)

  This example does not use the height, width, or align attributes as these are
  being phased out and you are encouraged to use CSS properties instead.
