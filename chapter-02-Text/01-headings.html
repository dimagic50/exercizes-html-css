<!--
  HTML has six "levels" of headings:
  <h1> is used for main headings, <h2> is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on...
  Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an <h1> element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6> element is the smallest.
  The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly. Users can also adjust the size of text in their browser. You will see how to control the size of text, its color, and the fonts used when we come to look at CSS.
