  class attribute:

  Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
  For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or
  you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your own site and links that point to external sites.
  To do this you can use the class attribute. Its value should describe the class it belongs to. In the example, key paragraphs have a class attribute whose value is important.
  The class attribute on any element can share the same value. So, in this example, the value of important could be used on headings and links, too.
  By default, using these attributes does not affect the presentation of an element. It will only change their appearance if there is a CSS rule that indicates it should be displayed differently.
  In this example, CSS has been applied to make elements with a class attribute whose value is important uppercase, and elements with a class attribute whose value is admittance red.
  If you would like to indicate that an element belongs to several classes, you can separate class names with a space, as you can see in the third paragraph in the example.
