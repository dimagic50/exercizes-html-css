  <iframe>
    An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
    One common use of iframes (that you may have seen on various websites) is to embed a Google Map into a page. The content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the same server or anywhere else on the web).
    An iframe is created using the <iframe> element. There are a few attributes that you will need to know to use it:
      
      src
        The src attribute specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame.
      height
        The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe in pixels.
      width
        The width attribute specifies the width of the iframe in pixels.
