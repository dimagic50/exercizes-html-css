<!--
  <dfn>
  The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as the defining instance of it.
  The <dfn> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term.
  Some browsers show the content of the <dfn> element in italics. Safari and Chrome do not change its appearance.
