<!--
  In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines. When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing. You will often see that web page authors take advantage of white space collapsing to indent their code in order to make it easier to follow.
