<!--
  <address>
  The <address> element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contain a physical address, but it does not have to. For example, it may also contain a phone number or email address.
  Browsers often display the content of the <address> element in italics.
  You may also be interested in something called the hCard microformat for adding physical address information to your markup.
