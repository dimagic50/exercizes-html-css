<!--
  <cite>
  When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the <cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
  In HTML5, <cite> should not really be used for a person's name â€” but it was allowed in HTML 4, so most people are likely to continue to use it.
  Browsers will render the content of a <cite> element in italics.
