	Checking the Size of Images
If you are updating a website, you might need to check the size of an existing image before creating a new one to replace it. This can be achieved by right-clicking on the image and making a selection from the pop-up menu that appears. (Mac users will need to hold down the control key and click rather than right-click.)

	Downloading Images
If you want to download images from a website, you can do so by accessing the same pop-up menu. (Please remember however that all images online are subject to copyright and require explicit permission to reuse.)
