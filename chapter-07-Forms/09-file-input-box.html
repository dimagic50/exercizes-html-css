<!--
  File Input Box:
    <input>
      If you want to allow users to upload a file (for example an image, video, mp3, or a PDF), you will need to use a file input box.
    type="file"
      This type of input creates a box that looks like a text input followed by a browse button. When the user clicks on the browse button, a window opens
      up that allows them to select a file from their computer to be uploaded to the website. When you are allowing users to upload files, the method
      attribute on the <form> element must have a value of post. (You cannot send files using the HTTP get method.)
      When a user clicks on the browse button, the presentation of the window that allows them to browse for the file they want to upload will match the
      windows of the user's operating system. You cannot control the appearance of these windows.
