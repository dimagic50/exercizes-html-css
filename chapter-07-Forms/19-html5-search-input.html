  HTML5: Search Input
  
  <input>
    If you want to create a single line text box for search queries, HTML5 provides a special type of input for that purpose.
  type="search"
    If you want to create a single line text box for search queries, HTML5 provides a special search input.
    To create the HTML5 search box the <input> element should have a type attribute whose value is search. Older browsers will simply treat it like a single line text box. Recent browsers add some features that improve usability. For example, Safari on a Mac adds a cross to clear the search
    box when you have started to enter information. Safari also automatically rounds the corners on the search input field.
