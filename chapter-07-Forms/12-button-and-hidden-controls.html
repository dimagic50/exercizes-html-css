<!--
  Button & hidden Controls:
    <button>
      The <button> element was introduced to allow users more control over how their buttons appear, and to allow other elements to appear inside the button. This means that you can combine text and images between the opening <button> tag and closing </button> tag.
    <input>
      type="hidden"
        This example also shows a hidden form control. These form controls are not shown on the page (although you can see them if you use the View Source option in the browser). They allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see.
        For example, a web page author might use a hidden field to indicate which page the user was on when they submitted a form.
