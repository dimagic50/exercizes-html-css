<!--
  Submit Button:
    <input>
      type="submit"
        The submit button is used to send a form to the server.
      name
        It can use a name attribute but it does not need to have one.
      value
        The value attribute is used to control the text that appears on a button. It is a good idea to specify the words you want to appear on a button because the default value of buttons on some browsers is ‘Submit query’ and this might not be appropriate for all kinds of form.
        Different browsers will show submit buttons in different ways and tend to fit the visual presentation of the browser.
        If you want to control the appearance of a submit button, you can either use CSS or you can use an image for the button.
