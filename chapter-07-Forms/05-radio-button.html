<!--
  Radio Button:
  
  <input>
    type="radio"
      Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options.
    name
      The name attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option the user selects. When a question provides users with options for answers in the form of radio buttons, the value of the name attribute should be the
      same for all of the radio buttons used to answer that question.
    value
      The value attribute indicates the value that is sent to the server for the selected option. The value of each of the buttons in a group should be different (so that the server knows which option the user has selected).
      PLEASE NOTE: Once a radio button has been selected it cannot be deselected. The user can only select a different option. If you are only allowing the user one option and want them to be able to deselect it (for example if they are indicating they agree to terms and conditions), you
      should use a checkbox instead.
    checked
      The checked attribute can be used to indicate which value (if any) should be selected when the page loads. The value of this attribute is checked. Only one radio button in a group should use this attribute.
