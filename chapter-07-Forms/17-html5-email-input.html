<!--
  HTML5: Email Input
  
  <input>
    HTML5 has also introduced inputs that allow visitors to enter email addresses and URLs. Browsers that do not support these input types will just treat them as text boxes.
  type="email"
    If you ask a user for an email address, you can use the email input. Browsers that support HTML5 validation will check that the user has provided
    information in the correct format of an email address. Some smart phones also optimize their keyboard to display the keys you are most likely to need when entering an email address (such as the @ symbol).
