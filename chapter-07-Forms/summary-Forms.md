# Summary FORMS

1. Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a `<form>` element.
2. Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
3. Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
4. HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
